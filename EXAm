#Results:
Proportion of WFH with support 68.17% of individuals who work from home report having social/emotional support.

Estimate: The difference in proportions is 0.05132, meaning that those who work from home are about 5.13% more 
likely to report social/emotional support.
p-value: < 2.2e-16, which is much smaller than 0.05. This means we ___reject the null hypothesis___, indicating 
that the difference in support between those who work from home and those who do not is statistically significant.
95% Confidence Interval: (0.04357, 0.05906), suggesting that the true difference in proportions lies between 4.36% and 5.91%.

Form a hypothesis test about an interesting variable, explore whether that variable adds something to understanding social and emotional support. 
Please provide both a p-value for the hypothesis test and a confidence interval. Write a short paragraph explaining the test
(carefully noting what is the null hypothesis) and explaining the results of that test.

H0:The proportion of people who lack social/emotional support is the same regardless of whether they have children under 5 in their household.

result <- prop.test(x, n, alternative = "two.sided", conf.level = 0.95)
print(result)

Result:
  By p-value I can understand that the observed difference in the proportions of
people lacking social/emotional support between those with and without children under 5
is very unlikely to have occurred by chance alone.
The interval (-0.0643, -0.0391) means that the true difference in proportions of 
people lacking support between the two groups is likely between -6.43% and -3.91%.
The negative sign suggests that the proportion of people lacking support is lower 
for those with children under 5 compared to those without children under 5.

#Predictors Used: 
The model uses age and EEDUC (education level) as predictors:
Age: Age is a continuous variable that captures the effect of age on income. 
Generally, age is positively associated with income until a certain point, after
which it may plateau or decline as people approach retirement.
EEDUC: Education level is a categorical variable that represents the highest level 
of education attained. It is often a strong predictor of income, with higher levels of 
education typically associated with higher earning potential.
#Polynomials in Age: The code does not currently include polynomials of age, 
but they could be considered to capture a non-linear relationship between age and income 
(such as income growth slowing after a certain age). Including a polynomial term could be done as follows:
Interpretation of Estimates:
Age: A positive estimate for age would mean that, as age increases, income tends to increase
EEDUC (Education Levels): The estimates for different education levels
reflect the difference in expected income relative to the reference category (the level not 
shown in the output). Higher education levels (e.g., bachelor's or graduate degrees) 
are generally expected to have positive estimates, indicating higher income.
